# roboticsFinalProject

## Overview

This is a project that utilizes OpenCV and Python to determine relative camera position from a current photo to a best matched photo's camera's position. 

## Running Prequisites 

Must have opencv 3.0 and python 2.7 installed on your computer. 
I used this guide to install: http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/15/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-osx/

Files must be set up in the same hierarchy 

## How to run

From terminal navigate to the main folder (the one that contains epipolarmain.py)

To test a photo run: 

python epipolarMain.py photo

where photo is replaced by the test image you want to use i.e. "test2.jpg"
